I was VERY excited to discover your MAX 10 tiny FPGA board on AliExpress. I immediately ordered 5 pieces, and can't wait to start experimenting with fitting it into a breadboard design I've been working on. Is it possible to get the KiCAD design files for this? I have already asked over AliExpress messaging regarding the files, and also possibility of volume purchasing. 

Thanks again,
Joe
