Hello, i have a problem with my Mbrush, the wifi wont work. Sometimes there is a Wifi Signal and sometimes not, but i never get a connection with my princube over wifi. I was on github and saw the post with the replacement of the capacitors, do you have any link which capacitors size it is and where specific i should solder it on? My warranty is over. 

Thanks maxi
