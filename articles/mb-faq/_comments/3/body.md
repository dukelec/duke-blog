Hi Duke, 
I'm working on a project where I want to attach the MBrush to a 3D Printer as an alternate tool. However, I need to make some changes to the firmware/hardware, specifically to change so that it prints at a constant speed that I can decide. I have looked through your github but I am not too familiar with the programming language/methods you used. Would you be able to guide me or point me in the right direction? 
Thanks! 
Oliver
