Hello Duke! My Mbrush had a firmware version 4.33, FW 4.16. I tried to update today to the APP 4.37, FW 4,19, but messed up selecting the files and ended by selecting the TAR file in the APP 5.1, FW5.1 section and updated with this one. The outcome is that my Mbrush doesn't respond anymore. It turns on with the white lights and doesn't do anything. No flashes, no green light, no beeps. I tried the programming mode procedure and it shows a different light behavior, suggesting it could be operational by programming mode. Anyway, I dont know how to use the programming mode to flash the right firmware. Can you help me on solving this? Is there a guide to flash a new firmware (or recover the original one) in the Mbrush after installing the wrong one?
