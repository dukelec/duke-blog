I just received my PrinCube and have what appears to be the "poor contact" issue with two solid lines across all prints (with a pattern ... so something the printer is actively doing). I am a bit nervous about disconnecting the communication ribbon (it appears to be set in place a bit more firmly than seems to be the case in the video). Is there a trick to this without potentially damaging the printer further?
