I have a problem, can someone help me?
I bought MBrusch.
It is printing, but I am unable to change the text.
Every time I make a new text an press Print I get the massage http://192.168.44.1  Loading, please try later
I wait for 1 or 2 hours also 2 days I have tried, but I get the same massage ”” loading, please try later””

What do I do wrong?

Hove can I write a new text witch I will print out, do I have to delete the old text, but hove do I do that.
I have several times tried to press DELITE nothing helps.

So I hope so much you can help me, so I finely can start using my MBrush.

I have tried with or without cable.
