Hi,
I bought the printer during the crowdfunding campaign.
I had already specified at the time that I wanted a printer with WATERPROOF ink.
But I only got the normal, water-soluble ink.
After that, I ordered the waterproof ink again individually in the shop.
I got a complete printer + water-soluble ink - so I got the wrong thing again.
I have now searched the internet for waterproof ink for the Princube / Mbrush, but apparently it is no longer available.
Everywhere this ink is sold out or not available at all.
It seems like I've been fooled.
