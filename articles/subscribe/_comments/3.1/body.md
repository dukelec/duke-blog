I'm also lookning into using PrinCube at an attachment to a 3D-printer.
Are the following calculation correct?
Picture width 10 cm
PrinCube 1200 x 600 DPI settings
PrinCube CGI set_conf "period_us=1674"
Printtime[seconds]:
10/2.54=3,937 Inch
3.937*600=2362 pixels
2362*0,001674=3,95 seconds
And also, what does "Global Density" in PrinCube Settings do?
